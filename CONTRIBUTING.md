# Contributing

We're thrilled to have you here! Feel free to create pull requests (PRs) and open issues - your contributions are valuable to us!

## Why We Use Issues
Before you dive into making changes, consider creating an [issue][issues_url] or discussions on our [discord server][discordserver_url] first. Here's why:

- Avoid Duplicate Work: Someone might already be working on a similar update. Checking issues prevents duplication of effort.
- Collaborative Problem Solving: Other contributors might have valuable insights or alternative solutions. Discussing changes beforehand can lead to better implementations.
- Save Your Time: Avoid working on updates that might not align with the project's direction. Consult with others to ensure your efforts are fruitful.

## Guidelines for Contributors

Follow these guidelines to make our work smoother and faster, otherwise your change might not be accepted:

1. **Check for Compatibility**:
   - Does your change break backward compatibility?
   - If it does then your change might not accepted, keep it compatible with old versions.

2. **Ensure Broad Usability**:
   - Will your changes work with other versions of Rocket or older versions, or if other Rocket for example [LDM][ldm_github_repository] installed but your edited version of RocketModFix is not installed?
   - If not, your change may not be accepted as it could cause problems such as breaking changes.

3. **Test Your Changes**:
   - Have you tested your change locally or in a test environment?
   - If not, test it to confirm it works as expected.

4. **Keep Things Simple**:
	- Do you keep things simple?
	- If not, try to keep things simple, for example: "Don't try to make things/code unique, hard, complex, etc, use and do simple and working solutions for the issue, no need to show yourself as a hulk.".

Keep these points in mind to help everyone use RocketModFix without issues.

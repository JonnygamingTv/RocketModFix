## Runtime Libraries

Here we just store the runtime libraries that are used by the Rocket or other plugins. These libraries are not included in the plugin itself, but are required to be present in the Module directory in order for Rocket itself and the other plugins to work correctly.

## Add/Update Runtime Library

To add/update a Runtime Library, keep these steps:
1. Have installed Mono/Unity Editor with the same version as in Unturned.
2. To find the needed library: `Program Files\Mono\lib\mono\gac` or also you can try this place: `Program Files\Mono\lib\mono\4.5\Facades`.
